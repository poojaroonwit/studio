---


## [1.2.4-beta.2] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- ✨ **Candidate Filter Popover**: Refactored candidate filters from a persistent sidebar to a modern popover button in the header, including an **Active Filter Badge** for immediate feedback on applied filters.
- ⚙️ **Manual Filter Apply**: Introduced "Apply Filters" and "Clear All" buttons in the candidate filters to prevent flickering and excessive data reloads while configuring multiple criteria.
- 🧹 **Code Cleanup**: Removed the legacy `CandidatesPageSidebar.tsx` and optimized property passing in the Candidates page header.

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Azure AD User Search**: Resolved `Request_UnsupportedQuery` error by removing unsupported sorting in the Graph API user fetch query.
- 🎨 **Splash Screen Behavior**: Optimized the splash screen to only show on the first session load, preventing it from appearing during normal page transitions.
- 📏 **Job Description Spacing**: Fixed excessive line spacing in the job description and match criteria sections of the Position Detail view, resulting in a more compact and readable layout.
- 🔧 **Type Safety**: Fixed several TypeScript build errors related to missing interface properties in `CandidateFilterValues`.
- 🐛 **Applicant Page Fixes**: Resolved "cn is not defined" error in candidate details and ensured the filter popover remains visible on desktop regardless of horizontal filter settings.


## [1.2.4-beta.1] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- ⚡ **Avatar Performance**: Implemented thumbnail optimization for Recruiter Avatars, reducing load times from seconds to milliseconds by resizing images on the server.
- 🐛 **Cross-Domain Cookies**: Resolved "No Session" errors for avatars on UAT/PROD by enforcing relative URLs and fixing the Azure AD sync job to store environment-agnostic paths.
- 🐛 **Duplicate Activity Logs**: Fixed duplicative activity entries when adding comments; now hiding redundant "Comment added" activity logs in favor of the comment feedback itself.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-01-22 (Consolidated Stable Release)

### Added
- ✨ **V2 API Infrastructure**: Introduced a new V2 API architecture (`/api/v2/*`) for high-performance external integrations and automation.

- 🐛 **Auth Reliability**: Resolved `CallbackRouteError`, 2FA bypass bugs, and cookie persistence issues.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
