# V1 Candidates API

This API provides endpoints for managing candidate information without job applications or job matches functionality.

## Base URL
```
/api/v1/candidates
```

## Authentication
All endpoints require authentication via NextAuth session.

## Automatic Fields

The following fields are automatically handled by the database and should not be included in request bodies:

- **`createdAt`**: Automatically set to the current timestamp when creating new records
- **`updatedAt`**: Automatically set to the current timestamp when updating records
- **`id`**: Automatically generated UUID
- **`applicationDate`**: Automatically set to the current timestamp when creating candidates

These fields are returned in API responses but are managed by the database schema and Prisma ORM.

## Automatic Recruiter Assignment

When creating or updating candidates through the v1 API, recruiters are automatically assigned based on the following rules:

- **New Candidates**: If a candidate is created with a `positionId` and the position has a recruiter assigned, the candidate will automatically be assigned to that recruiter
- **Updated Candidates**: If a candidate's position is changed and the new position has a recruiter, the candidate will be automatically assigned to that recruiter
- **Bulk Operations**: When using bulk position assignment, all affected candidates will be automatically assigned to the position's recruiter
- **Import Operations**: When importing candidates with a position but no recruiter, they will be automatically assigned to the position's recruiter

**Note**: Existing recruiter assignments are preserved and will not be overwritten by automatic assignment.
