## 1. Search Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Search UI
    participant API as Next.js API (v1/ai/search)
    participant Flow as Search Flow (ai/flows)
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Gemini as Google Gemini

    UI->>API: POST /search { query: "..." }
    API->>Flow: searchapplicantsAIChat(query)
    
    Flow->>DB: Fetch ALL applicant Metadata (Summary)
    Flow->>Gemini: POST /generateContent (Context + Query)
    
    Note over Gemini: Matches query against JSON metadata
    
    Gemini-->>Flow: JSON: { matchedIds: [...], reasoning: "..." }
    Flow->>API: Result
    API-->>UI: Filtered applicant List
```

## 2. Smart Extraction Logic

### 1. High-Precision Matching
The system uses a strict **system prompt** that enforces "Exact Matching Only" to prevent AI hallucinations.
- **No Semantic Inference**: If a user asks for "React", the AI won't return "Angular" developers unless they also have React.
- **Normalization**: Automatically handles cases like "TOEIC", "toeic-score", and "Toeic" as identical identifiers.

### 2. Contextual Summary Generation
Before sending data to Gemini, the system builds a concise `applicantSummary` for every applicant in the database:
- Aggregates **Education**, **Experience**, and **Skills**.
- Includes **Custom Attributes** (e.g., salary expectations, certifications).
- Streams these summaries to the AI to minimize token usage while maximizing relevant context.

### 3. AI Reasoning
The search results include an `aiReasoning` field which explains **why** a specific applicant was matched (e.g., "applicant X mentions TOEIC score 850 in their custom fields").

## 3. Supported Query Types

| Query Type | Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Certifications** | "Who has a CPA license?" |
| **Language** | "applicants with native English and Thai." |
| **Skill Depth** | "Experienced Python devs with > 5 years." |
| **Fit Scores** | "Fit score between 80% and 90%." |
| **Logic** | "Hired in 2024 but no longer at Company X." |
