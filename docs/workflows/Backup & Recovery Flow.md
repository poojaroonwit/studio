## 1. Backup Strategy

FitScan follows a tiered backup approach to protect the three core pillars of the system.

```mermaid
graph TD
    System[FitScan System] --> DB[PostgreSQL Data]
    System --> S3[MinIO Objects]
    System --> Conf[System Settings]

    DB -->|pg_dump| DB_File[backup.sql.gz]
    S3 -->|tar| S3_File[minio.tar.gz]
    Conf -->|npm run| Conf_File[settings.json]
```

## 2. Recovery Workflow

| Step | Action | Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Database** | Restore schema and records. | `psql` |
| **2. Storage** | Restore resume PDFs and avatars. | `tar -xz` |
| **3. Config** | Restore runtime environment variables. | `settings:import` |
| **4. Verify** | Run application health checks. | `GET /api/health` |

## 3. Automated Tasks

### Daily Snapshots
The system is configured with a **Crontab** (by default at 02:00 AM) that performs:
1.  **DB Dump**: Compresses the entire PostgreSQL database.
2.  **Object Sync**: Backs up the MinIO `candidatrack_minio_data` volume.
3.  **Rotation**: Keeps the last 30 daily backups, deleting older ones to save space.

### Migration Management
For major infrastructure moves, specialized scripts like `migrate_minio_mc.py` are used to sync data between S3 buckets while preserving metadata and permissions.

## 4. Disaster Recovery (DR) Scenarios
- **Node Failure**: Kubernetes automatically redeploys pods; data is persistent via **StatefulSets**.
- **Data Corruption**: Revert to the previous night's backup at 02:00 AM.
- **Service Outage**: Check `LogEntry` for "ETIMEDOUT" or "ECONNREFUSED" to identify if the DB or MinIO is the bottleneck.
